## 👨‍💻 About <a name="about"></a>

[THEATERIX](https://www.theaterix.com) is an online catalogue of full-length plays of theater.

This is a non-profit project and only seeks to boost the theater industry and the culture of consuming alternative content at home.

[THEATERIX](https://www.theaterix.com), Stories so big they can not fit on the big screen.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name="getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development, testing and production purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

This is a very simple web application that uses the VueJs framework to get results from an external or internal API. This application points to an API endpoint that returns a list of JSON results. When the user reaches the page limit, we load more results from the API.

**Notes**:

- I'm importing libraries directly in my HTML just to simplify the full cycle of development and deploy.
- Maybe you should use dependency managers such as [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install#global-install) to handle the packages and other resources.

### Prerequisites:

Install **Git**: [https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

---

Open your terminal and type:

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/theaterixcom/theaterixcom.github.io.git
```

After that, just type:

```bash 
cd theaterixcom.github.io
```

If you don´t have experience with terminals, you can open the [GitHub Desktop app](https://desktop.github.com/) in your OS and go to `File` > `Clone Repository` > `URL` tab and type:
```
theaterixcom/theaterixcom.github.io
```
After, just click the `CLONE` button.


Finally you have the simplest option: download and unzip the following `.zip` file with all the files and resources:

## 🎈 Usage & 🚀 Deployment <a name="usage"></a> <a name="deployment"></a>

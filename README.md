# Vue infinite scroll with JSON API
A very simple example of a web application that uses the Vue.js framework to get results from an external API.

This application points to an API endpoint that returns a list of JSON results. When the user reaches the page limit, we load more results from the API.

**Note:** *I'm importing libraries in my HTML just to simplify the integration. Maybe you should use dependency managers such as NPM to handle the packages and other resources.*
